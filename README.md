(Ignore the lame title)

This is a sample app that uses `rails` to serve the api, and `react` as the frontend framework, in a single project.

Tested and running on:

- `rails` ^5.1 (in API mode)
- `react` ^16.0

The setup is based on this [guide](https://medium.com/superhighfives/a-top-shelf-web-stack-rails-5-api-activeadmin-create-react-app-de5481b7ec0b).
The folder structure follows `rails`, but all frontend codes are now in `client` folder.

### Installation

```
bundle install
cd client && npm install
```

### Development

```
rake start
```

That will start the rails server and the node server (for compiling the js codes).

### Testing

Currently not available, sorry :(
